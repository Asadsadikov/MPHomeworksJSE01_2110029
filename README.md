HW2:
A new Flutter project for homework 2.

We have a main function, which is essential for every single flutter project.
And main function calls "MyHomePage" widget. It includes MaterialApp, Scaffold, text widgets and one stateless and stateful widget.
"Greeting" stateless widget requires one string which is a greeting.
Stateful widget has a button and text which is changing it's number after button is pressed. As widget is changing its appearance in one run, (no coding), the widget needs a stateful widget.
To run the project, copying the main.dart file's code to the new project on online emulator(flutlab) is enough.
